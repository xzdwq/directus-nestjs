# Displays

Displays are functions / components that are used in the system to display data. They are small wrappers that help
display values in a matter that makes sense for the saved value, for example rendering a color swatch for a saved color
value.

## Functions vs Components

A _Display_ can either be a function, or a component. The function gets the value, and returns a string of how to
display this value. A Vue component similarly gets the value through the `value` prop, and can render whatever makes
sense for the value.

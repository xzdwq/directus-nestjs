# Filter Rules

> Permissions, validation, and the API's `filter` parameter all rely on a specific JSON structure to define their rules.
> This page describes the syntax for creating flat, relational, or complex filter rules.

[[toc]]

## Syntax

- **Field** — Any valid root field, [relational field](#relational), or [logical operator](#logical-operators)
- **Operator** — Any valid [filter operator](#filter-operators)
- **Value** — Any valid static value, or [dynamic variable](#dynamic-variables)

```
{
	<field>: {
		<operator>: <value>
	}
}
```

### Examples

```json
{
	"title": {
		"_contains": "Directus"
	}
}
```

```json
{
	"owner": {
		"_eq": "$CURRENT_USER"
	}
}
```

```json
{
	"datetime": {
		"_lte": "$NOW"
	}
}
```

The following operator has no Title on the Filter Interface as it is **only available in validation permissions**:

| Operator                | Description              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `_regex` <sup>[2]</sup> | Field has to match regex |

<sup>[1]</sup> Only available on Geometry types.\
<sup>[2]</sup> JavaScript "flavor" regex. Make sure to escape backslashes.

## Relational

You can target related values by nesting field names. For example, if you have a relational Many-to-One `author` field,
you can set a rule for the `author.name` field using the following syntax.

```json
{
	"author": {
		"name": {
			"_eq": "Rijk van Zanten"
		}
	}
}
```

## Logical Operators

You can nest or group multiple rules using the `_and` or `_or` logical operators. Each operator holds an array of rules,
allowing for more complex filtering.

```json
{
	"_or": [
		{
			"_and": [
				{
					"user_created": {
						"_eq": "$CURRENT_USER"
					}
				},
				{
					"status": {
						"_in": ["published", "draft"]
					}
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"_and": [
				{
					"user_created": {
						"_neq": "$CURRENT_USER"
					}
				},
				{
					"status": {
						"_in": ["published"]
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

## Dynamic Variables

In addition to static values, you can also filter against _dynamic_ values using the following variables.

- `$CURRENT_USER` — The primary key of the currently authenticated user
- `$CURRENT_ROLE` — The primary key of the role for the currently authenticated user
- `$NOW` — The current timestamp
- `$NOW(<adjustment>)` - The current timestamp plus/minus a given distance, for example `$NOW(-1 year)`,
  `$NOW(+2 hours)`

::: tip Nested User / Role variables in Permissions

When configuring permissions, `$CURRENT_USER` and `$CURRENT_ROLE` allow you to specify any (nested) field under the
current user/role as well as the root ID. For example: `$CURRENT_ROLE.name` or `$CURRENT_USER.avatar.filesize`. This
includes custom fields that were added to the directus_users/directus_roles tables.

Note: This feature is only available for permissions, validation, and presets. Regular filters and conditional fields
currently only support the root ID.

## Creating an Item

1. Navigate to the collection where you want to add an item
2. Click on the "Create Item" (+ icon) button located in the header
3. Complete the Item Detail form
4. Click the "Save Item" (âœ“ icon) button located in the header

::: tip Singletons

If the Collection is configured as a "Singleton" in the data model settings, then the App will automatically skip step

## Manually Sorting Items

1. Navigate to the [Content Module](/app/overview/#_1-module-bar)
2. Navigate to the collection of the items you want to sort
3. Choose a layout that supports manual sorting (eg: the default "table" mode)
4. Enable manual sorting. (eg: for the table layout, click on the Sort column's header)
5. Drag items by their handle into a new position

The new sort order is saved automatically, so make sure you wait until the App's loading indicator finishes before
navigating away from the page.

::: warning Requires Configuration

This feature is only available if a Sort column has been configured in the Collection's data model settings.

## Ordering Items

1. Navigate to the [Content Module](/app/overview/#_1-module-bar)
2. Navigate to a collection of items
3. Choose a layout that supports manual ordering (eg: the default "table" mode)
4. Set the Order Field and Order Direction
   - Table Layout: Click on the field's column header, clicking again changes order direction
   - Card Layout: Adjust the two dropdowns in the layout's subheader

::: tip Sort vs Order

**Ordering** is a non-destructive action (does _not_ change your data) used to browse items alphabetically or
numerically. **Sorting** (when enabled) saves a value in a [Sort](/reference/query/#sort) field, which can then be used
to return data in a custom order.
